    <p id="Fonts">I love the person that I am. I have many great traits and characteristics that make me who I am. I love to read, write, solve math problems, do science experiments, help people, and just being a great person. I love to hang out with my friends and just have fun. I go to Penn Wood High School and I am going to 10th grade.  I have 3 brother and 3 sisters, I am the middle child. I have two best friends, Kendall and Zylia, I like to spend the night at Kendall’s house so we can have fun and play games; Zylia lives in New Jersey so I don’t see often but because our birthdays are 4 days apart I go to visit her around that time. I think I am most thankful to have my parents and my grandmother. My mom and dad are great they always encourage me to do my best. They really want me to succeed so they always tell me how important going to school is so education is held very high in my family. My grandmother is probably my favorite person in the world. I know I can always count on her for anything and I know that she will always be happy with me if I am being who I am.    </p>
    <p id="Fonts">I hate many kinds of foods. I don't like any kinds of berries. I also don't like peanut butter, but I like peanuts, I also don't like mangos, peaches, plums, and pears. </p>
